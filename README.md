+ This repository contains algorithm implementations for ECFramework and their average stats (in .xls form) aquired by running tests on the 24 COCO functions from the ECF (30 times for each function)


 Algorithms implemented :
	+ Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG)
	+ Optimization Immune Algorithm (opt-IA) 


+ Also it contains post-processed data acquired using COCO
