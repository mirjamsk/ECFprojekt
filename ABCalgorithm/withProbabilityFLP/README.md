ABC algorithm for ECFramework
=============================

see e.g. http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Artificial_bee_colony_algorithm)
 
 
ABC algorithm accepts only a single FloatingPoint genotype (vector of real values).
Additionally, it adds the following genotypes for algorithm implementation:
 * 		trial: floatingPoint genotype serving as a generation counter for each individual
 *		probability: floatingPoint genotype for calculating the probability of getting chosen for each individual


=============================
*important: main.cpp is from ECF_1.3/examples/COCO/*
