ABC algorithm for ECFramework
=============================

This directory contains 2 implementations of Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for ECFramework: 
+ one is implemented with the built-in ECF operator for selecting best individuals
+ other is implement w/o said operator, instead algorithm adds a FloatingPoint Genotype for each individual in the population which contains the selection probability  value

=============================
*important: main.cpps are from ECF_1.3/examples/COCO/*
