\providecommand{\bbobpptablesmanylegend}[1]{Expected running time (ERT in number of function evaluations)
                     divided by the respective best ERT measured during BBOB-2009 (given in 
                     the respective first row) for different $\Df$ values in #1. 
                     The central 80\% range divided by two is given in braces. 
                     The median number of conducted function evaluations is additionally given in 
                     \textit{italics}, if $\ERT(10^{-7}) = \infty$.
                     \#succ is the number of trials that reached the final target $\fopt + 10^{-8}$.
                     Best results are printed in bold. }
